# erwin-gateway integration guide

This guide is enough for a new internal app to authenticate with `erwin-gateway`, call app APIs, send chat, and receive signed webhooks.

## 1. Register an app

Use the admin UI Apps page or the admin API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.example.com/api/admin/apps \
  -H 'X-Admin-API-Key: <admin-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Example App",
    "slug": "example-app",
    "permissions": ["chat:messages:send", "chat:messages:receive"],
    "webhookUrl": "https://example.internal/erwin-gateway/webhook",
    "webhookEventFilters": ["twitch.chat.message", "twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.add"]
  }'
```

Seeded MVP apps are `erwin-music` and `erwin-hatchery`. Keep permissions least-privilege; every app API route checks the app's permissions.

## Permission matrix

Use this matrix when requesting permissions for a registered app. All app-facing `/api/v1/*` routes require a valid app API key; rows marked "app API key only" do not require an additional app permission today.

| Gateway capability | Route or event | Required app permission | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App identity smoke test | `GET /api/v1/me` | App API key only | Returns the authenticated app identity, enabled state, permissions, and key metadata. |
| Send chat messages | `POST /api/v1/chat/messages` | `chat:messages:send` | Also requires an `idempotency_key` for every outgoing chat write. |
| Chat message webhooks | `twitch.chat.message` | `chat:messages:receive` | Delivered to apps whose webhook filters match the event type. |
| Chat command webhooks | `twitch.chat.message` | `chat:commands:receive` | Commands are delivered as `twitch.chat.message` events with `chat.is_command = true`; subscribe to `twitch.chat.message` until a distinct command event type is intentionally added. |
| Channel Point reward read | `GET /api/v1/channel-points/rewards`, `GET /api/v1/channel-points/rewards/:rewardId`, reward sync/read helpers | `channel_points:rewards:read` | Read access includes listing and inspecting reward records. |
| Channel Point reward create | `POST /api/v1/channel-points/rewards` | `channel_points:rewards:create` | Creates app-owned custom rewards through the gateway. |
| Channel Point reward update | `PATCH /api/v1/channel-points/rewards/:rewardId` | `channel_points:rewards:update` | Only the owning app can mutate an app-owned reward. |
| Channel Point reward delete | `DELETE /api/v1/channel-points/rewards/:rewardId` | `channel_points:rewards:delete` | Deletes or disables a manageable app-owned reward. |
| Channel Point redemption read | `GET /api/v1/channel-points/redemptions`, Twitch redemption fetch helpers | `channel_points:redemptions:read` | Required to list or inspect redemptions. |
| Channel Point redemption manage | `PATCH /api/v1/channel-points/rewards/:rewardId/redemptions/:redemptionId/status` | `channel_points:redemptions:manage` | Required to fulfill or cancel redemptions after downstream processing. |
| Channel Point webhook events | `twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.add`, `twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.update` | `channel_points:events:receive` | Used for Channel Point redemption event delivery. |
| Stream status/profile/schedule | `GET /api/v1/channel/status`, `GET /api/v1/streams/current`, `GET /api/v1/channels`, `GET /api/v1/channels/:channelId/profile`, `GET /api/v1/channels/:channelId/schedule`; stream/profile webhooks | `streams:read` | Also gates `twitch.stream.online`, `twitch.stream.offline`, and `twitch.channel.update` webhook delivery. |
| Subscriptions | `GET /api/v1/subscriptions`, subscription webhook events | `subscriptions:read` | Includes live subscription EventSub deliveries such as `twitch.channel.subscribe` and gift/message/end variants. |
| Subscription backfill | `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/backfill` | `subscriptions:backfill` | Use for historical or repair backfill runs. |
| Bits | `GET /api/v1/bits/leaderboard`, Bits webhook events | `bits:read` | Includes `twitch.channel.cheer` webhook delivery. |
| Bits backfill | `POST /api/v1/bits/backfill` | `bits:backfill` | Use for Bits leaderboard repair/backfill runs. |
| Webhook delivery inspection | `GET /api/v1/webhook-deliveries`, `GET /api/v1/webhook-deliveries/:deliveryId` | App API key only | Current app-facing routes are scoped to deliveries owned by the authenticated app and do not require a separate permission. If a dedicated delivery-inspection permission is added later, update this row. |
| Webhook delivery retry | `POST /api/v1/webhook-deliveries/:deliveryId/retry` | App API key only | Current app-facing retry is scoped to deliveries owned by the authenticated app and does not require a separate permission. If a dedicated delivery-retry permission is added later, update this row. |

## 2. Generate an API key

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.example.com/api/admin/apps/<app-id>/keys \
  -H 'X-Admin-API-Key: <admin-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"production"}'
```

The response includes `rawKey` once. Store it in the consuming app's secret manager. The gateway stores only a key prefix and HMAC hash. Revoke old keys with:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://gateway.example.com/api/admin/apps/<app-id>/keys/<key-id> \
  -H 'X-Admin-API-Key: <admin-key>'
```

Revoked keys fail authentication immediately.

## 3. Call `/api/v1/me`

```bash
curl https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/me \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>'
```

A successful response returns the app identity, enabled state, permissions, and API key metadata. Use this as a startup smoke test in downstream apps.

## 4. Send a Twitch chat message

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/chat/messages \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Thanks for voting!",
    "idempotency_key": "vote-round-2026-05-18T00:00:00Z",
    "for_source_only": true,
    "priority": 0
  }'
```

Requirements:

- Permission: `chat:messages:send`.
- `idempotency_key` is required for every outgoing chat write.
- Reusing the same key with the same body returns the existing queued/sent message.
- Reusing the same key with different message parameters returns `409` and does not enqueue a duplicate.

Check status with:

```bash
curl https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/chat/messages/<message-id> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>'
```

## 5. Receive and verify webhooks

Webhook deliveries are JSON `POST` requests to the app webhook URL. Headers:

```text
X-Erwin-Gateway-Delivery-Id: <delivery uuid>
X-Erwin-Gateway-Event-Id: <event uuid>
X-Erwin-Gateway-Timestamp: <ISO timestamp>
X-Erwin-Gateway-Signature: sha256=<hex hmac>
X-Erwin-Gateway-App-Id: <app uuid>
```

Signature input is:

```text
delivery_id + timestamp + raw_body
```

Node verification example:

```js
import crypto from 'node:crypto';

export function verifyGatewayWebhook({ secret, deliveryId, timestamp, rawBody, signature }) {
  const expected = `sha256=${crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(deliveryId)
    .update(timestamp)
    .update(rawBody)
    .digest('hex')}`;
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(signature));
}
```

Important receiver rules:

- Verify against the exact raw request body, not parsed/re-serialized JSON.
- Reject old timestamps to limit replay risk.
- Store `X-Erwin-Gateway-Delivery-Id` or payload `event_id` to make your handler idempotent.
- Return any `2xx` response only after the app has durably recorded the event or safely detected a duplicate.

Common event types and filters:

- `twitch.chat.message`
- `twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.add`
- `twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.update`
- `twitch.*` for all Twitch events
- `*` for all deliverable events
- `twitch.channel.subscribe`
- `twitch.channel.subscription.gift`
- `twitch.channel.cheer`
- `twitch.stream.online`
- `twitch.stream.offline`

## Idempotency expectations

- Gateway write endpoints require idempotency keys where duplicate external effects are possible.
- Chat sends dedupe by `(app, scope, idempotency_key)` and reject same-key/different-body conflicts.
- EventSub messages dedupe by Twitch message ID.
- Channel Point redemptions dedupe by Twitch redemption ID.
- Downstream webhook receivers must also dedupe because HTTP retries can deliver the same event more than once.

## Retry and dead-letter behavior

- Webhook deliveries retry on network errors and non-2xx responses.
- Retry attempts use bounded exponential backoff and are recorded in delivery attempts.
- After the retry limit, the delivery is marked `dead_lettered` and appears in admin diagnostics.
- Operators can inspect and force retry delivery from the admin UI/API after fixing the downstream app.
- Outgoing chat messages also retry safe Twitch failures and dead-letter permanently failed sends with status, response excerpts, and diagnostic context that excludes secrets.

## Health checks for consumers

- `GET /api/v1/health/live` confirms the process is running.
- `GET /api/v1/health/ready` confirms database/Twitch readiness.
- `GET /api/v1/health/deep` includes scope, EventSub, queue, Channel Point, Bits/subscription, and dead-letter diagnostics.

## 6. Downstream client implementation examples

The examples below are intentionally app-side code, not gateway internals. They show the minimum patterns each downstream app should copy before it starts producing external effects.

### 6.1 Authenticated gateway client with common error handling

Use `Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>` on every `/api/v1/*` request. Treat the API key as a secret and do not log it.

```ts
const gatewayBaseUrl = process.env.ERWIN_GATEWAY_URL ?? 'https://gateway.example.com';
const appApiKey = process.env.ERWIN_GATEWAY_APP_API_KEY!;

type GatewayErrorCode = 401 | 403 | 404 | 409 | 429 | 500 | 502 | 503 | 504;

class GatewayError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public status: GatewayErrorCode,
    message: string,
    public responseBody: unknown,
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}

function gatewayErrorMessage(status: number) {
  if (status === 401) return 'Gateway API key is missing, malformed, revoked, or invalid.';
  if (status === 403) return 'Gateway API key is valid but the app lacks the required permission.';
  if (status === 404) return 'Gateway resource was not found or does not belong to this app.';
  if (status === 409) return 'Idempotency conflict: the same key was reused with different request parameters.';
  if (status === 429) return 'Gateway or upstream Twitch rate limit reached; retry after the response delay if provided.';
  if (status >= 500) return 'Gateway or upstream dependency is temporarily unavailable; retry with backoff.';
  return `Gateway request failed with HTTP ${status}.`;
}

export async function gatewayFetch<T>(path: string, init: RequestInit = {}): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(new URL(path, gatewayBaseUrl), {
    ...init,
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${appApiKey}`,
      Accept: 'application/json',
      ...(init.body ? { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } : {}),
      ...init.headers,
    },
  });

  const text = await response.text();
  const body = text ? JSON.parse(text) : null;

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new GatewayError(
      response.status as GatewayErrorCode,
      gatewayErrorMessage(response.status),
      body,
    );
  }

  return body as T;
}
```

Recommended handling by status:

| Status | App action |
| --- | --- |
| `401` | Stop startup or disable gateway features until the app API key is fixed. Do not retry with the same key in a hot loop. |
| `403` | Treat as configuration drift. Request the missing permission for the registered app. |
| `404` | Verify the app owns the requested reward, message, delivery, or redemption before retrying. |
| `409` | Use the existing resource returned by the gateway if available; otherwise create a new stable idempotency key only for a genuinely new action. |
| `429` | Back off, respect `Retry-After` if the gateway returns it, and keep the original idempotency key for retried writes. |
| `5xx` | Retry with exponential backoff and jitter; preserve idempotency keys so retries do not duplicate Twitch side effects. |

### 6.2 Send chat with a stable `idempotency_key`

Build the key from a business identifier that stays the same across process restarts, queue retries, and deploys. Do not use a random UUID per retry.

```ts
type SendChatResponse = {
  message: {
    id: string;
    status: 'queued' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'retrying' | 'dead_lettered';
    idempotencyKey: string;
  };
};

export async function announceVoteRound(roundId: string, text: string) {
  const idempotencyKey = `erwin-music:vote-round:${roundId}:announcement:v1`;

  return gatewayFetch<SendChatResponse>('/api/v1/chat/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: text,
      idempotency_key: idempotencyKey,
      for_source_only: true,
      priority: 0,
      metadata: {
        source: 'erwin-music',
        round_id: roundId,
      },
    }),
  });
}
```

If the app times out after sending this request, retry the same payload with the same `idempotency_key`. The gateway returns the existing queued or sent message for exact duplicates and returns `409` when the same key is reused for different message parameters.

### 6.3 Verify webhook signatures from the raw body

The gateway signs the concatenation of `X-Erwin-Gateway-Delivery-Id`, `X-Erwin-Gateway-Timestamp`, and the exact raw request body using the app webhook signing secret. The receiver must verify the signature before parsing or trusting the payload.

```ts
import crypto from 'node:crypto';
import express from 'express';

const webhookSigningSecret = process.env.ERWIN_GATEWAY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET!;
const app = express();

function timingSafeSignatureCheck(expected: string, received: string) {
  const expectedBytes = Buffer.from(expected, 'utf8');
  const receivedBytes = Buffer.from(received ?? '', 'utf8');
  return expectedBytes.length === receivedBytes.length
    && crypto.timingSafeEqual(expectedBytes, receivedBytes);
}

function verifyErwinGatewayWebhook(headers: Record<string, string | string[] | undefined>, rawBody: Buffer) {
  const deliveryId = String(headers['x-erwin-gateway-delivery-id'] ?? '');
  const timestamp = String(headers['x-erwin-gateway-timestamp'] ?? '');
  const signature = String(headers['x-erwin-gateway-signature'] ?? '');

  const ageMs = Math.abs(Date.now() - Date.parse(timestamp));
  if (!deliveryId || !timestamp || !signature || Number.isNaN(ageMs) || ageMs > 5 * 60_000) {
    return false;
  }

  const expected = `sha256=${crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', webhookSigningSecret)
    .update(deliveryId)
    .update(timestamp)
    .update(rawBody)
    .digest('hex')}`;

  return timingSafeSignatureCheck(expected, signature);
}

app.post('/erwin-gateway/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {
  if (!verifyErwinGatewayWebhook(req.headers, req.body)) {
    return res.status(401).send('invalid signature');
  }

  const payload = JSON.parse(req.body.toString('utf8'));
  await handleGatewayEvent(payload);
  return res.status(204).send();
});
```

Framework notes:

- Configure the route to expose the raw request body as bytes. Do not verify against `JSON.stringify(req.body)` after a JSON parser has normalized whitespace or key order.
- Use the `X-Erwin-Gateway-Delivery-Id` header for delivery-level dedupe and the payload `event_id` for event-level dedupe.
- Reject stale `X-Erwin-Gateway-Timestamp` values, for example older than five minutes, to limit replay risk.

### 6.4 Store webhook idempotency records before side effects

Persist idempotency keys in your app database before granting inventory, posting chat, updating ledgers, or fulfilling/canceling redemptions. A single Twitch EventSub event can be delivered more than once, and one logical Twitch redemption can appear in both `add` and `update` flows.

```sql
CREATE TABLE erwin_gateway_processed_events (
  delivery_id text PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id text NOT NULL,
  twitch_redemption_id text,
  event_type text NOT NULL,
  processed_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (event_id),
  UNIQUE (twitch_redemption_id)
);
```

```ts
type GatewayWebhookPayload = {
  delivery_id: string;
  event_id: string;
  type: string;
  redemption?: { id: string; status: string; user_input?: string };
  reward?: { gateway_reward_id?: string; id: string; title: string };
};

async function handleGatewayEvent(payload: GatewayWebhookPayload) {
  const twitchRedemptionId = payload.redemption?.id ?? null;

  const inserted = await db.processedEvents.insertIgnore({
    deliveryId: payload.delivery_id,
    eventId: payload.event_id,
    twitchRedemptionId,
    eventType: payload.type,
  });

  if (!inserted) {
    return; // duplicate delivery_id, event_id, or Twitch redemption id: acknowledge without repeating side effects
  }

  if (payload.type === 'twitch.channel_points.custom_reward_redemption.add') {
    await grantRewardAndSettleRedemption(payload);
  }
}
```

Choose uniqueness based on the external effect:

- `delivery_id`: prevents repeating work for the same HTTP delivery retry.
- `event_id`: prevents repeating work when the same gateway event is redelivered.
- Twitch redemption id (`payload.redemption.id`): prevents granting the same Channel Point reward twice across `add`, `update`, manual retry, or app reprocessing paths.

### 6.5 Fulfill or cancel Channel Point redemptions

The gateway records redemptions but does not auto-fulfill or auto-cancel them. After your app durably completes or rejects its domain work, call the explicit status endpoint for the app-owned reward.

Fulfill after successful domain work:

```ts
async function fulfillRedemption(rewardId: string, redemptionId: string, ledgerTransactionId: string) {
  return gatewayFetch(`/api/v1/channel-points/rewards/${rewardId}/redemptions/${redemptionId}/status`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      status: 'FULFILLED',
      reason: `Granted reward in ledger transaction ${ledgerTransactionId}`,
    }),
  });
}
```

Cancel when the app cannot safely complete the reward:

```ts
async function cancelRedemption(rewardId: string, redemptionId: string, reason: string) {
  return gatewayFetch(`/api/v1/channel-points/rewards/${rewardId}/redemptions/${redemptionId}/status`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      status: 'CANCELED',
      reason: reason.slice(0, 500),
    }),
  });
}
```

Typical redemption flow:

1. Verify the webhook signature from the raw body.
2. Insert `delivery_id`, `event_id`, and `redemption.id` into the app idempotency table.
3. Run the app's domain transaction, such as granting an item, writing an economy ledger entry, or validating user input.
4. Call `PATCH /api/v1/channel-points/rewards/:rewardId/redemptions/:redemptionId/status` with `FULFILLED` only after the domain transaction commits.
5. Call the same endpoint with `CANCELED` when validation fails or the app cannot complete the reward.
6. Return `2xx` from the webhook only after the duplicate check and domain decision are durable.

Required permissions:

- `channel_points:redemptions:read` to list or inspect redemptions.
- `channel_points:redemptions:manage` to fulfill or cancel redemptions.

### 6.6 Inspect and retry webhook deliveries

Downstream apps can inspect only their own deliveries through the app-facing `/api/v1/webhook-deliveries` endpoints.

List recent failed or dead-lettered deliveries:

```bash
curl 'https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/webhook-deliveries?status=dead_lettered&limit=25' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>'
```

Inspect one delivery and its attempts:

```bash
curl 'https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/webhook-deliveries/<delivery-id>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>'
```

Force a retry after fixing the receiver:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://gateway.example.com/api/v1/webhook-deliveries/<delivery-id>/retry' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <app-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}'
```

Operational guidance:

- Retry only after the app is ready to accept the event and its idempotency table is working.
- Expect the same `event_id` and domain identifiers again when a delivery is retried.
- Inspect delivery attempts for HTTP status, error text, and response excerpts before retrying repeatedly.
- Use status filters such as `queued`, `retrying`, `delivered`, and `dead_lettered` when triaging incidents.
